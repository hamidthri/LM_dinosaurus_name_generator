# Dinosaur Name Generation Using RNN

This repository contains Python code for generating dinosaur names using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The RNN is trained on a dataset of dinosaur names and can generate new names based on the learned patterns.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Other dependencies (mentioned in `requirements.txt`)

## Getting Started
